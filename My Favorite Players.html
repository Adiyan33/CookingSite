<h2> My Second Favorite NBA Player is Kyrie Irving!<h2>
<p> <strong>Strengths:</strong> One of the best three level scorer (3s, midrange, finishing), Crazy ballhandling/dribbling ability. </p>
<p> <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>Passing (has improved but needs to be better), defense, dribbles too much sometimes and hogs the ball which ruins the flow of the offense.</p>
